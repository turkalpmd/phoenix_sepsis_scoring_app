# Phoenix Sepsis and Phoenix-8 Sepsis Criteria Implementation

In 2024, significant advancements were made in the field of pediatric sepsis with the introduction of the Phoenix criteria. This set of guidelines was developed to replace the previous definitions from 2005, which were based on the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and had become outdated. The new criteria were devised to provide more accurate diagnostics and improve outcomes for pediatric sepsis by focusing on life-threatening organ dysfunction as a key indicator.

Our project aims to incorporate these new criteria into practical tools that can enhance sepsis diagnosis and management. This GitHub repository is dedicated to developing a Python library that aids in the automated scoring and data processing of pediatric sepsis cases using the latest Phoenix criteria.

For further reading on the Phoenix criteria, you are encouraged to visit the official repository documentation [here](https://github.com/CU-DBMI-Peds/phoenix/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Overview of the Phoenix Criteria Development

The new Phoenix criteria for pediatric sepsis were developed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine's (SCCM) Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce. This was a response to the need for a more precise definition of sepsis that includes life-threatening organ dysfunction alongside infection. These criteria were developed through a comprehensive process that involved an international survey of clinicians, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and cohort studies, covering over three million children globally.

The updated criteria aim to better identify children with infections at higher risk of poor outcomes and are designed to be globally applicable, including in low-resource settings. These have been endorsed and adopted by major health organizations around the world and have been proven to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in pediatric sepsis.

## Future Directions

The ongoing development of this repository is focused on expanding the toolkit available for clinicians to diagnose and manage pediatric sepsis effectively. We invite contributions from the community to further enhance the capabilities of our tools and to support global efforts in improving pediatric sepsis care.

Thank you for your interest in our project. Your feedback and contributions are essential to our mission of advancing pediatric healthcare through innovation and collaboration.
