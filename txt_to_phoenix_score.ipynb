Two days prior to admission, she suffered from a chest blunt trauma with a soccer ball while walking. After the impact, she fell from her height and hit the ground. She was taken immediately to the ED, where on physical examination, no skin changes or respiratory distress was found, and only tenderness of the impact area and a mild graze on the left elbow were described. On chest radiograph, the physician reported a fracture of the 2nd anterior arc rib; and she was discharged home with general recommendations. On readmission 2 days later, both the surgical trauma and pediatric emergency teams approached the patient. Axillary temperature was 39°C, pulse rate 210/minute, respiratory rate 15/minute, and oxygen saturation on room air 81%. Noninvasive blood pressure was impossible to be obtained. She had a toxic appearance, cold and pulseless extremities, pallor skin, and Glasgow coma scale of 15. The upper left hemithorax looked edematous and violaceous (Figure 1), but no subcutaneous emphysema or crepitations were felt. No evidence of intraabdominal bleeding was detected by FAST ultrasound. In the ED, she was intubated to protect airway and fluid resuscitation was initiated. A portable chest X-ray showed left hemithorax soft tissue edema and decreased pulmonary volume ipsilaterally (Figure 2). A chest CT revealed left apical pulmonary contusion, two fractured ribs (2nd and 3rd anterior arc ribs), and a possible collection of blood, soft tissue edema, subcutaneous fat infiltrations, and muscular thickening with gas in the subclavicular space (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Laboratory investigations revealed a CBC with 22,000 leukocytes/mm3 (12% neutrophils, 63% band forms), hemoglobin 13 gr/dL, and platelets 82,000/mm3. Blood gases showed pH 7.0, pCO2 71 mmHg, pO2 23 mmHg, EB −12, and  17 mEq/L. Lactic acid was 6.9 mmol/L, BUN 28 mg/dL, creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, and CRP 120 IU/L. Two blood cultures drawn at admission from her femoral vein and subclavian CVC revealed Gram-positive cocci on stain; however, morphologically these could not be identified, no additional testing including molecular techniques was possible to obtained, and there was no bacterial growth at the end on both cultures. The patient underwent septic shock and multiorgan failure. In the ED, dopamine and adrenaline infusions were started after volume expansion. Intravenous cefotaxime (200 mg/kg/day) and clindamycin (40 mg/kg/day) were started in addition to multiple transfusions of fresh frozen plasma, red blood cells, and hydrocortisone. She was transferred to the PICU. Within 24 hours, the patient deteriorated significantly; progression of the skin lesions worsened (Figure 4), with new hemorrhagic blister skin lesions and severe edema and erythema extending to the left lateral chest wall. Because the patient was still very unstable, surgical debridement was on hold. She died 32 hours after PICU admission due to refractory septic shock and multiorgan failure.\"\"\"\n",

Noradrenaline infusion was started for deep persistent hypotension in spite of three times of isotonic saline solution. Dobutamine was started for cardiac decompensation and he was intubated for respiratory insufficiency.

Serum ammonia was 71 mmol/L. Vancomycin, meropenem, and amikacin sulfate were started. Platelet and fresh frozen plasma transfusion were given for prolonged coagulation tests. Bacillus cereus was isolated in blood cultures obtained from the catheter and from a peripheral vein. The strain was sensitive to meropenem and amikacin.

    "case_summary=\"\"\"A 3-year-old previously healthy white male patient presented to his primary care physician with fever, rhinorrhea, and conjunctivitis. He was prescribed azithromycin for atypical pneumonia and otitis media. Over the subsequent 4 days, he had persistent fever and developed altered mental status. On evaluation in the emergency department, he was somnolent, with respiratory insufficiency and shock. A chest radiograph confirmed bilateral pneumonia. The result of a brain MRI with gadolinium contrast was normal. Lumbar puncture opening pressure was not elevated, and the cerebrospinal fluid was acellular, with normal glucose and protein levels. An EEG was consistent with encephalopathy. Respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel testing of nasal secretions was positive for adenovirus. After fluid resuscitation and empirical antibiotics, he was admitted to the PICU for further management. On hospital day 2, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and circulatory shock requiring mechanical ventilation and vasoactive infusions. Because of refractory hypoxemia and hypotension, he was cannulated onto veno-arterial ECMO. Serum quantitative PCR at the time of decompensation revealed an adenovirus load of >560 000 copies per mL (upper limit of detection), confirming adenoviremia. Blood specimens were genotyped by PCR amplification and sequencing of a ∼400-nt segment of the hexon gene.8  The isolate was genotyped as adenovirus type 7. No additional pathogens were identified on blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or tracheal aspirate cultures. A laboratory evaluation revealed additional evidence of MOF with acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic dysfunction, pancreatitis, pancytopenia, and coagulopathy. He fulfilled criteria for viral-associated secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis9  and was treated with plasma exchange, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, 2 mg/kg per day of methylprednisolone, and intravenous immunoglobulin.One week into his ECMO course, there were no signs of organ recovery, and serum PCR measurements revealed persistent adenoviremia above the upper limit of detection (Fig 1A). The decision was made, in consultation with the infectious disease service, to administer cidofovir. Because of AKI and fluid overload requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), he received 1 mg/kg of cidofovir with normal saline hydration and probenecid. Positive fluid balance was maintained for 8 hours after the infusion for renal protection. Three days after the first cidofovir dose, adenoviremia decreased to 285 000 copies per mL. A total of 3 cidofovir doses were administered weekly until adenovirus levels became undetectable. After his AKI and fluid overload resolved (Fig 1B), the cidofovir dose was increased to 5 mg/kg. Severe lymphopenia, with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of ≤500 cells per μL, was present on admission, and the ALC did not exceed 1000 cells per μL until after the third and final dose of cidofovir.\"\"\"\n",
